# st2195_assignment_2

Create a **GitHub** repository called “st2195_assignment_2” that includes:

1. A “README.md” file with a short markdown description of this assignment [_1 point_]
2. A folder called “r_csv” with a R code for scraping the CSV example on cars in the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values and saving the resulting output in the local folder (in CSV) [_4.5 points_]
3. A folder called “python_csv” with a Python version of the code in point 2
[_4.5 points_]

Note that it is advised to use the packages rvest (R) and **BeautifulSoup** (Python) for scraping operations. **RSelenium** (R) and **Selenium** (Python) can also be used, but they are generally more complicated to setup.
